        "designSummary": "**The Quiet Authority: Elegant Project Oversight**\n\nThe Vision: This design system is crafted to instill trust and convey a premium, sophisticated confidence, mirroring the precision of a bespoke tailor's studio. It prioritizes timeless quality and quiet luxury, ensuring every element feels deliberate and important. The interface will be an oasis of calm, guiding users through complex data with intuitive clarity and understated elegance.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Layout & Spacing: Emphasize symmetrical, balanced layouts with generous whitespace. Every element will have room to breathe, creating a sense of order and calm.\n2. Typography: A harmonious pairing of classic, high-contrast Serif fonts for headlines and clean, light-weight Sans-Serif fonts for body text will establish a sophisticated hierarchy and readability.\n3. Color Palette: A muted, desaturated, and predominantly monochromatic scheme (soft off-whites, greys, deep blacks) will form the base. A single, subtle metallic accent (soft gold) will be used sparingly for key interactive elements.\n4. Components: Elements will be defined by their form and spacing rather than heavy decoration. Buttons will adopt ghost or text-only styles. Animations will be subtle and slow, focusing on gentle fade-ins to enhance the premium feel.\n5. Avoidance: Strictly avoid loud or neon colors, playful or chunky fonts, chaotic layouts, heavy drop shadows, and harsh gradients.",

    "designSummary": "**The Quiet Authority: Elegant Project Oversight**\n\nThe Vision: This design system is crafted to instill trust and convey a premium, sophisticated confidence, mirroring the precision of a bespoke tailor's studio. It prioritizes timeless quality and quiet luxury, ensuring every element feels deliberate and important. The interface will be an oasis of calm, guiding users through complex data with intuitive clarity and understated elegance.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Layout & Spacing: Emphasize symmetrical, balanced layouts with generous whitespace. Every element will have room to breathe, creating a sense of order and calm.\n2. Typography: A harmonious pairing of classic, high-contrast Serif fonts for headlines and clean, light-weight Sans-Serif fonts for body text will establish a sophisticated hierarchy and readability.\n3. Color Palette: A muted, desaturated, and predominantly monochromatic scheme (soft off-whites, greys, deep blacks) will form the base. A single, subtle metallic accent (soft gold) will be used sparingly for key interactive elements.\n4. Components: Elements will be defined by their form and spacing rather than heavy decoration. Buttons will adopt ghost or text-only styles. Animations will be subtle and slow, focusing on gentle fade-ins to enhance the premium feel.\n5. Avoidance: Strictly avoid loud or neon colors, playful or chunky fonts, chaotic layouts, heavy drop shadows, and harsh gradients.",

  "initialPrompt": "Создать веб-сервис для департамента мониторинга строительных проектов государственной жилищной компании. Сервис должен облегчать работу сотрудников, автоматически анализировать Excel-отчёты, прогнозировать риск ухудшения статуса проектов (ML), визуально выделять проблемные проекты и помогать принимать решения. Основные страницы: дашборд с общей статистикой и предупреждениями, таблица проектов с фильтрацией и сортировкой по риску, карточка проекта с историей и объяснением прогноза, страница загрузки отчётов. Интерфейс — простой, интуитивный, с цветовой индикацией и графиками. Backend: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, FastAPI или Flask. Frontend: Streamlit или React + API. ML: интерпретируемая модель (Logistic Regression/Random Forest) для бинарной классификации риска.",
